                    To become a real boy, all the wooden puppet, Pinnochio, had to do was be brave, truthful and unselfish. But he was having
                    trouble living up to any of those ideals. He had already lied to the blue fairy. And then he had been weak and selfish by
                    going to Pleasure Island.

                    Rabbit was tired of being bounced by Tigger- bounced and trounced and knocked down by Tigger. So he was quite happy when he
                    and his friends found Tigger and Roo stuck up in a tree. "Tigger can't bounce anybody as long as he's stuck up in that tree,"
                    Rabbit said cheerfully.

                    Long ago, in the kingdom of Agrabah, the Sultan wanted to make sure that his only daughter would always be cared for, so he 
                    insisted on following the law that said the princess must marry a prince before her 16th birthday. Princess Jasmine had only 
                    three days left in which to choose a husband.
